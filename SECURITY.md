# Security Implementation Details

This document outlines the security features and implementation details of the Credify application, which can be used for the security review process.

## Authentication Security

### Password Handling
- All passwords are hashed using bcrypt (Laravel's default hashing mechanism)
- The password field is never returned in API responses (`$hidden` in User model)
- Password complexity is enforced: minimum 8 characters, at least 1 uppercase letter, and 1 number

### CSRF Protection
- Web routes are protected by Laravel's `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware
- SPA authentication uses proper CSRF token handling with `sanctum/csrf-cookie` endpoint
- Frontend axios interceptors automatically attach CSRF tokens to requests

### Rate Limiting
- Login and registration endpoints are rate-limited to 6 requests per minute
- Rate limiting uses the built-in Laravel `ThrottleRequests` middleware

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

### Implementation
- Uses the `pragmarx/google2fa` package for TOTP generation
- QR codes are generated securely using `bacon/bacon-qr-code`
- 2FA secrets are encrypted in the database
- 2FA verification is required after password login when enabled

### Security Measures
- 2FA setup requires the user to be already authenticated
- 2FA secret is never exposed to the client after initial setup
- Disabling 2FA requires re-authentication
- Temporary tokens for 2FA verification have short expiry times (5 minutes)

## Session and Token Management

### Sanctum Configuration
- Uses Laravel Sanctum for SPA authentication
- Configured with stateful domains for secure cookie handling
- Session-based authentication for first-party SPA access
- Token-based authentication for API access

### Logout Security
- Logout invalidates the current session
- API tokens are properly revoked on logout
- Users can view and terminate active sessions
- Option to terminate all other sessions remotely

## Input Validation and Sanitization

### Request Validation
- All input is validated using Laravel's form request validation
- Custom validation rules for complex requirements
- Frontend form validation for immediate user feedback

### SQL Injection Prevention
- Uses Laravel's query builder and Eloquent ORM with parameterized queries
- Input is never directly concatenated into SQL statements

## Environment and Configuration Security

- Sensitive configuration stored in `.env` file (excluded from version control)
- Database credentials stored as environment variables
- No hard-coded secrets in the codebase
- Docker secrets for sensitive information in containers

## Security Headers and CORS

- Secure headers configured for HTTP responses
- CORS configured to only allow specific origins
- Cookies set with secure attributes (HttpOnly, SameSite policy)

## Logging and Auditing

- Login attempts are logged (success and failure)
- Last login IP and timestamp are recorded
- User agent information is stored for each login
- Sensitive data is never logged

## Security Compliance

This implementation follows security best practices and meets the requirements specified in the project security checklist. It addresses OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities related to authentication and session management.
