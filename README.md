# Credify â€” PayPal-like App (Scaffold)

This repository contains a scaffold for the Credify project: a PayPal-like app built with Laravel 12 (backend), React + Vite + Tailwind (frontend), and PostgreSQL, containerized with Docker Compose.

This scaffold includes:
- docker-compose.yml
- backend/ (Laravel app placeholder)
- frontend/ (React Vite app placeholder)
- .env.example

Next steps:
1. Run `docker compose up --build` to build containers.
2. Enter the `backend` container and install dependencies, or follow the detailed setup in backend/README when implemented.

Note: This is the initial scaffold. I'll now add docker-compose, .gitignore, and basic dockerfiles.
