## Quick Start

### Using Setup Script (Recommended)

We've provided setup scripts to make the installation process easier:

#### Linux/macOS
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akuichi/credify.git
cd credify
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

#### Windows
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Akuichi/credify.git
cd credify
.\setup.bat
```

After running the setup script, start the application with:
```bash
docker compose up
```

### Manual Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akuichi/credify.git
cd credify
```

2. Copy environment files
```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

3. Install composer dependencies (critical step)
```bash
# Option 1: Install locally (recommended)
cd backend
composer install
cd ..

# Option 2: Install via Docker
docker compose run --rm app composer install
```

4. Build and start the Docker containers
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

5. In a new terminal, run the setup commands
```bash
# Generate application key
docker compose exec app php artisan key:generate

# Create storage links
docker compose exec app php artisan storage:link

# Run database migrations
docker compose exec app php artisan migrate --seed

# Clear cache
docker compose exec app php artisan cache:clear
docker compose exec app php artisan config:cache
```

6. Configure email settings in `.env`
```bash
# Edit the backend/.env file and configure email settings
# See "Email Configuration" section below for details
```

7. Access the application
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - API: http://localhost:8000/api

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with missing vendor directory:
```
Warning: require(/var/www/vendor/autoload.php): Failed to open stream
```

The most common issue is that the vendor directory is being overwritten. Try:
1. Install dependencies locally (see step 3 above)
2. Or remove the vendor mount from docker-compose.yml:
   ```
   # Comment out this line:
   # - ./backend/vendor:/var/www/vendor
   ```

## Email Configuration

The application supports multiple email providers. Choose one of the following options:

### Mailtrap (Recommended for Development)

1. Create a free account at [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/)
2. Go to your Mailtrap inbox
3. Click on "SMTP Settings" and select "Laravel" from the dropdown
4. Copy the provided credentials
5. Update the following values in your `.env` file:
```
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=your_mailtrap_username

### Gmail SMTP (For Testing/Production)

1. Create or use an existing Gmail account
2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication for that account at [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
